                <h3>More than just a music festival</h3>
                <p>A music festival is a community event oriented towards live performances of singing and instrument
                    playing that is often presented with a theme such as musical genre (e.g., blues, folk, jazz,
                    classical
                    music), nationality, or locality of musicians, or holiday. They are commonly held outdoors, with
                    tents
                    or roofed temporary stages for the performers. Often music festivals host other attractions such as
                    food
                    and merchandise vending, dance, crafts, performance art, and social or cultural activities. At music
                    festivals associated with charitable causes, there may be information about social or political
                    issues.
                    Many festivals are annual, or repeat at some other interval. Some, including many rock festivals,
                    are
                    held only once. Some festivals are organized as for-profit concerts and others are benefits for a
                    specific charitable cause. Another type of music festival is the educative type, organized annually
                    in
                    local communities, regionally, or nationally, for the benefit of amateur musicians of all ages and
                    grades of achievement.</p>

                <h3>Life tastes better with coffee</h3>
                <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea
                    species. The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia
                    and
                    Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean. Coffee plants are
                    now
                    cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast
                    Asia,
                    Indian subcontinent, and Africa. The two most commonly grown are C. arabica and C. robusta. Once
                    ripe,
                    coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are
                    roasted
                    to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with
                    near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee. Coffee is darkly colored, bitter,
                    slightly
                    acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It is one of
                    the
                    most popular drinks in the world, and it can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g.,
                    espresso, French press, caffè latte). It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is a popular
                    alternative. Clinical studies indicate that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly
                    beneficial
                    in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption lowers the risk of some
                    diseases, although those long-term studies are of generally poor quality.</p>

                <h3>American dream</h3>
                <p>The American Dream is a national ethos of the United States, the set of ideals (democracy, rights,
                    liberty, opportunity and equality) in which freedom includes the opportunity for prosperity and
                    success,
                    as well as an upward social mobility for the family and children, achieved through hard work in a
                    society with few barriers. In the definition of the American Dream by James Truslow Adams in 1931,
                    "life
                    should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability
                    or
                    achievement" regardless of social class or circumstances of birth. The American Dream is rooted in
                    the
                    Declaration of Independence, which proclaims that "all men are created equal" with the right to
                    "life,
                    liberty and the pursuit of happiness."Also, the U.S. Constitution promotes similar freedom, in the
                    Preamble: to "secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity".</p>

                <h3>A day exploring the Alps</h3>
                <p>The Alps, straddling Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, have no shortage of places that are likely
                    already on your bucket list—the iconic Matterhorn, the legendary Black Forest, and the
                    picture-perfect
                    village of Hallstatt. There are many other sights that, even if not as well known, should be on your
                    must-see list: the Philosopher’s Path in Heidelberg, the Chapel Bridge in Lucerne, and the
                    jaw-dropping
                    castle at Kufstein. Perhaps the first step in planning a bucket-list itinerary to the Alps, however,
                    is
                    acceptance. You won’t be able to see it all, and you’re going to have to make some hard subjective
                    choices among many alluring options. The good news, however, is that you pretty much can’t go wrong
                    wherever you choose to travel. The itinerary here starts in the old university town of Heidelberg,
                    packed with intellectual history and culture, and ends in the Austrian lakeside town of Hallstatt,
                    part
                    of a UNESCO World Heritage Site with its long history as a salt mining center that stretches back to
                    the
                    days of the Celts and Romans. In between, you’ll pamper yourself with Black Forest spa treatments,
                    discover the wonderfully walkable city of Lucerne, and admire the towering peaks around Zermatt.
                    After
                    visiting Innsbruck, the nearby Kufstein fortress town beckons. By the end of your trip, you are sure
                    to
                    have fallen under the spell of one of Europe’s most magical regions.</p>
